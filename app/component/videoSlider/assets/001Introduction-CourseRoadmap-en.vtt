Welcome I hope that you're ready to learn a ton about re-act native.

00:05.340 --> 00:08.390
My name is Stephen Greider and I will be your instructor.

00:08.400 --> 00:13.530
I've written many courses on react and this course in particular is my second course focused on Riak

00:13.530 --> 00:14.460
native.

00:14.460 --> 00:20.490
I have collected a tremendous amount of feedback on why students want to learn Riak native and this

00:20.490 --> 00:23.270
course is kind of like the culmination of that effort.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.290
Every topic is carefully presented in a very specific order to make sure that you can walk away from

00:28.290 --> 00:33.010
this course with the skills that you need to build awesome native applications.

00:33.150 --> 00:37.980
So the overwhelming goal here like the thing we're really going to drive home towards is building usable

00:37.980 --> 00:43.090
real applications in addition to just you know learning hey what the heck is Riak native.

00:43.140 --> 00:47.080
My goal with this course is to start coding on real projects as soon as possible.

00:47.190 --> 00:52.410
But Riak native makes that just a little bit difficult as it requires a little environment set up ahead

00:52.410 --> 00:56.880
of time so we're going to go through a little bit of getting started stuff in the next couple of sections

00:56.880 --> 00:59.810
before we start Rikan our first application.

00:59.970 --> 01:04.080
Even if you already ran through the reality of installation if you could do it like you know a couple

01:04.080 --> 01:06.780
of months ago hey no problem you'd probably skip it.

01:06.900 --> 01:11.610
But if you install re-act native like when it first came out then I really recommend that you go through

01:11.610 --> 01:18.240
the installation directions because set up with Riak native is kind of a little bit notoriously difficult.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.680
Now one quick word about compact compatibility with their operating system.

01:21.780 --> 01:24.660
If you're using OSX so you're using a Mac.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.580
We will be going through set up with both iOS and Android.

01:28.690 --> 01:35.010
So need to run iOS and Android applications and if using Windows will be setting up just Android because

01:35.010 --> 01:41.160
Windows does not have Iowa support with re-act need it just yet officially I should say the official

01:41.160 --> 01:45.540
Riak native documentation has instructions for set up with Linux as well.

01:45.690 --> 01:48.660
So if you're running Linux you can certainly go through those directions.

01:48.660 --> 01:51.330
But we will not be going through it on this course.

01:51.390 --> 01:53.060
Do the actual videos.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.550
Every app that we build in this course is going to be 100 percent compatible with both iOS and Android.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.830
So no need to sweat getting left in the cold.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.310
If you do not have the perfect OS setup.

02:03.510 --> 02:07.680
So with that in mind let's get started with our environment setup in the next section
